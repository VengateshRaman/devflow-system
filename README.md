🧠 DevFlow System

DevFlow is a full-stack developer platform built using modern frontend and backend technologies within a structured monorepo architecture.
This project is designed to demonstrate:
Scalable frontend architecture with Next.js
Type-safe development with TypeScript
High-performance backend APIs using FastAPI
Modular system design
ML-ready backend integration
Production-oriented engineering practices
